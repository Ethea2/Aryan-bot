# KNS-bot
Practicing Python through creating a discord bot.

I'm a 1st year CS student trying new things out! 

bot features:
  1. Music Player
  2. Ping Checker
  3. 8ball (Filipino and English)
  4. Stratroulette
  5. Wikipedia (Scraping wikipedia)
  6. Zed (Sends random pictures of my Cat named "Zed")
  7. Rock Paper Scissors (English and Filipino, with secret commands)
  8. Exchange gift pairs feature for parties!

It's also heavily inspired by the dankmemer bot >:D
